# The Odin Project Web Development Foundations
# Rock Paper Scissors Game
A rock paper scissors game using HTML, CSS, and javascipt.

This project had two phases:
1. Implementing a simple game playable in the browser console
2. Implement a UI for the game so that the player can play the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt
